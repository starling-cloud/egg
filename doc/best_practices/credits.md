Crediting Authors
Since Grasshopper is a relatively new tool, academic standards have not yet fully been defined and plagiarism of Grasshopper definitions occurs frequently. As is the case for academic writing, to claim someone else's work as your own is plagiarism and therefore in violation with the TU Delft Code of Ethics. To avoid this, we insist that you credit the authors for parts of your Grasshopper definitions you did not make.


Grasshopper Forum


The Mcneel Rhinoceros forums
Grasshopper is supported with a Forum that uses an open-platform ideology which means that many definitions are used and shared across the world. The forum can be a useful way to solve technical problems with your Grasshopper definitions. When you ask questions and/or upload definitions, usually somebody responds and offers help. If somebody on the forum fixed a part of your definition, you need to identify the portion of the definition which the person altered, credit the author and list the date when this occured.



Plugins and User Components


Plugins can be found at Food4Rhino.com
Accross the forum and on personal blogs or webpages, you will find many plug-ins and/or user components. These are either clusters or scripts (VB, Python, or C#) made by individuals who deserve credit when you are using them. List the author, the URL where you've retrieved them from and list the date when this occured.


How to Credit Authors


Crediting an Author, from Cosmatu, 2014 "Unroll Surface and Breps"
For TU Delft purposes, we define a standard method for crediting authors. If you fail to comply with this and your instructors notice that you are using definitions that are not your own, you will be subject to further examining.

Following the example in the image on the right, group the part of the definition (or user component) and define the group color as white. Underneath you will place panel (also colored white) that outlines all necessary information.
