Phase Model


Phase Model
To help you create a systemic setup, it is highly recommended you make use of a phase model. A phase-model illustrates a time-based description of a process and all the contributors and their relations in terms of the information exchanged and the order of operations. Each phase develops in complexity as the relations between contributors become more interdependent. It should help you to hierarchically structure your decision process.



Flow Chart


Example of a Flowchart in complex setups, from Nourian, Rezvani, Sariylidiz, 2013, "Space Syntax for Generative Design"
A flowchart is a conventional graphical representation of a computational design process in relation to its sequence of functions and the data transferred between those functions. A flowchart is constantly revised as the computational workflow also changes.



Flow Chart Symbols


Conventional symbols used in Flowcharts
Please use the following symbols to represent your computational process.

Start/End: an oval represents a start or end point
Data: a parallelogram represents input or output
Decision: a diamond indicates a decision
Process: a rectangle represents a process
Connectors: A line is a connector that shows relationships between the representative shapes and the sequential order of the decision making process



Example of a flowchart as made for a TU Delft course
This is a simple representation of the functional steps you have to make to get the network you need for your task. It can be even more simple then this example.
