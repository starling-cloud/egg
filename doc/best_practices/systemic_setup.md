# Systemic Setup


Inputs and Outputs
Make a systemic setup by clearly identifying systems consisting of inputs, processes and outputs. A system is an abstract notion of a group of things that work together like the machines of a production line. Therefore it might be useful to think of your model as a production line with machines that can be altered or substituted at any moment without disrupting the entire production line.


Use Pseudo Code


Some basic written pseudo code
Before jumping into Grasshopper, it is important to have a step by step logic of what you want to do and a clear idea of how you are going to do it. This is also known as pseudo-code. In Informatics, pseudo-code is an informal description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm that uses the structural conventions of a normal programming language. It is intended for human reading rather than machine reading.


Be Systematic/Methodical
The Grasshopper file should be structured according to a systematic procedure. Think of your whole process as a method to produce something of certain quality levels. Ideally, the method should be re-applicable to generate various instances of the same product. Refer back to your description (pseudo-code) of the process and organize your file according to those steps.
