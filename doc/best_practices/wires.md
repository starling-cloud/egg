Consistent Wire Types


Use Hidden Wires when passing Design Variables around the canvas and Faint when passing Objects/Results from one module to another. Copy frequently used Design Variables to the locations on the canvas where they will be used again and connect them with Hidden wires. This way your files will not turn into a spaghetti-like mess.

You can replace a single item wire, list of items wire or data tree wire by a faint of hidden wire. Make sure the user can always track where the wire comes from.
