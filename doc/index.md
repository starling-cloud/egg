**Starling Egg is a Grasshopper template geared towards project collaboration.**

Starling Egg is a powerful and flexible tool that can help design teams to work more efficiently and effectively on their scripts. Whether you are working on a large-scale architectural project or a smaller design project, this template is sure to be a valuable asset in your design toolkit. In general, it can offer several benefits to designers:


1. **Collaboration.**
This template allows multiple designers to work together on a single Grasshopper definition, making it ideal for projects where a team-based approach is required.

2. **Streamlined Workflow.**
By using a pre-configured template, designers can save time and effort in setting up their project. This allows them to focus on their design process and iterate faster.

3. **Consistent Organisation.**
The templates helps to maintain consistency across multiple projects or within a team. They help in organizing complex scripts and algorithms in a more structured manner, making it easier to understand and modify.

4. **Quality Assurance.**
By using a well-designed template, designers can ensure that their designs meet certain quality standards and avoid common mistakes. This can lead to better overall outcomes and increased efficiency.

5. **Customization.**
Templates can be tailored to a designer's specific needs and preferences, providing a personalized starting point for each project.


Customize the template to fit your needs: The Starling Egg template is designed to be flexible and adaptable, so you can customize it to fit the specific needs of your project. You can add new components, modify existing ones, and create your own tools and workflows.

**Starling Egg** consists of a reference document and a Rhino + Grasshopper template.

The reference document describes how to start a new Grasshopper script, how to connect to the internal and packages, and how to visually organise and annotate the Grasshopper definition, so that it is easy to read, reusable and open for further development and changes.

The Grasshopper Template is a part of every Grasshopper project. It guides the workflows of the designer as the Grasshopper definition is being created.
