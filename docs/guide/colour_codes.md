When organizing your spaghetti you should definitely use colour labels for grouping. Making a group of components is one thing, giving correct colours – another. I recommend creating one template in your company so that the same colours are always used for predefined groups. Start with this template every time a new script or cluster is created. One for initial data, another for steps, yet another for output and so on. You can make it manually or write a small script which will do it for you. All you need to do is write the correct name of the group and colour will change automatically.




The colour and the name of a group can be changed by right-clicking on it.
